# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. The game will start automatically.
3. Players take turns clicking on the squares to make their moves.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Files Included

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- style.css: The CSS file containing the styles for the game interface.
- script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the game.

## Implementation Details

- The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid of squares.
- Each square can be empty, contain an "X" symbol for the first player, or contain an "O" symbol for the second player.
- JavaScript is used to handle user clicks, check for wins or draws, and update the game state accordingly.
